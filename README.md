Convert React elements to strings ðŸ‘Œ

React-To-String allows you to easily convert React elements to pure strings -
no HTML tags, no react attributes - just strings.

This is useful for when you might want to toggle between eventful & styled
React elements & a pure string version of those elements.

React-To-String itself has 0 dependencies and has a minimized bundle size of 1kb. âš¡

You can use React-To-String to easily convert complex react-elements like:
```es6
<div>

    Feeling <a href="/tired">tired</a>? Need some <a href="/food">food</a>?
    { ' ' }
    <button>Try React-To-String!</button>
    { ' ' }
    <span className="small-text">
      Disclaimer: This library only converts React elements to strings.
    </span>

</div>
```

to

`Feeling tired? Need some food? Try React-To-String! Disclaimer: This library
